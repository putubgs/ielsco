     title: "Jo's Week Long Adventure at ISUFST, Philipines üáµüá≠",
     content: `<div>
<div><strong>From Malang to the Philippines, George Abraham‚Äîbetter known as Jo‚Äîbrought the spirit of IELS across borders. As a Project Leader at IELS and a Computer Science student from Universitas Brawijaya, Jo spent a week on a cultural and academic exchange program at Iloilo State University of Fisheries Science and Technology (ISUFST).</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>During his stay, Jo had the chance to explore <strong>five different campuses</strong>, join IT-focused short courses, and engage with both faculty and students. The experience wasn‚Äôt only about academics‚Äîit was about immersion. From joining local tours and exploring the city, to enjoying the beaches of Iloilo, Jo embraced the warmth of Filipino culture with excitement and curiosity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>‚ÄúWhat made the journey even more special was how English became my bridge,‚Äù</strong> Jo shared. Conversations with fellow students and lecturers flowed naturally, even when he stumbled or made small mistakes. <em>‚ÄúAs long as you have the confidence to speak, you‚Äôll be fine. People aren‚Äôt that scary‚Äîespecially when they know you‚Äôre still learning too.‚Äù</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For Jo, his time at ISUFST wasn‚Äôt just an academic trip; it was proof of how language can unlock global experiences. Being part of the IELS community gave him the courage and practice to communicate confidently in real-world settings. <strong>From English Lounge discussions to teamwork inside IELS projects, he felt prepared to step outside Indonesia and connect internationally.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Jo‚Äôs story is a reminder that opportunities often come to those who dare to try. By stepping into new environments, embracing mistakes, and trusting the skills he built with IELS, he showed that Indonesian students can thrive on the global stage.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>‚ÄúI hope more students realize that English isn‚Äôt just a subject‚Äîit‚Äôs a passport. If you have the willingness to learn and the courage to use it, the world becomes a lot closer.‚Äù</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

     content: `<div>
<div><strong>Shania Rizky Henanto‚Äîone of IELS‚Äôs Project Leaders and a proud student of Universitas Singaperbangsa Karawang (UNSIKA)‚Äîstepped onto the international stage as Indonesia‚Äôs representative at the prestigious ASEAN Classroom 2025 program.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Supported by her faculty and backed by her active journey with IELS, Shania joined the ASEAN Classroom alongside students from top universities across the region. For a week, she took part in <strong>international forums, cross-cultural discussions, and collaborative projects</strong> designed to strengthen regional cooperation among Southeast Asian youth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Being <strong>chosen as a delegate for UNSIKA</strong> was no small feat. It reflected years of her consistent participation in academic and organizational activities, and her passion for representing Indonesia in global platforms. From working with international peers to sharing perspectives on youth leadership, Shania carried both her identity and her country‚Äôs pride with confidence.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>‚ÄúEnglish was the key that unlocked it all,‚Äù</strong> Shania shared. <em>‚ÄúI use English every single day at IELS, and that practice built my confidence. In international settings, people don‚Äôt judge you like grammar police‚Äîthey value your ideas and your courage to speak up.‚Äù</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Through IELS, Shania found a space to sharpen her communication, collaborate with peers, and grow into a leader ready for the global stage. <strong>Her journey in Malaysia proves that when language meets opportunity, Indonesian students can shine brightly among the best in Southeast Asia.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>‚ÄúI want others to know that English isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about connection. The more you practice, the more confident you become. And with confidence, the world opens its doors to you.‚Äù</em></div>
