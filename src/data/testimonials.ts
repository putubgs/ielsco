      "Joining IELS Lounge has been such a fun experience! In just one month, there were already so many activities to join ü§≠ Totally worth it, especially since the membership price is very affordable. <br/><br/>Oh, and the members are all super kind and friendly! That‚Äôs definitely a big plus, everyone is here to learn English (including me hahaa) and the vibe is always supportive, no judgment even for beginners üôå<br/> <br/> I really hope IELS keeps growing, and hopefully the membership price stays the same too üôè",

The environment here is so supportive, it makes us more confident to try speaking without worrying about mistakes.<br/><br/> That‚Äôs why the Speaking Club has been the most memorable part for me, it feels like learning while playing, so enjoyable!",
